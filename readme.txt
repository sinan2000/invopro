This application was made for a friend who started a small business. Its' only
purpose is to help him be more organized and also have me learning new things
that I can do with a package such as tkinter. This is only a prototype, far from an
application that can be offered to a real customer, but I think I did a good job for its purpose
and I enjoy knowing that even at application that is at such a small scale can
actually help someone out. For privacy reasons, I removed the logo image and the
database file is empty. For better aspect of image, it can be resized.
All the files can be found on github, the app is fully functional:

When Adding a new order, if in details you insert lines of actual product which
were added by you spaced by the amount, the total sum will be calculated and printed
in the console. If the product name is invalid/ not in db, it will be ignored.

**as a matter of fact, in the following update I plan to add these new features:
1. functions for verifying if the input in the entry boxes is valid(eg. no characters
for price box)
2. being able to print the order details on an invoice template that's added in the
project files as a pdf, so it can be printed or sent to the customer
3. create function that takes as parameter the name of the field, so that I can make
the code much more readable(for example instead of Tk.Label and Tk.Entry, i would just call
create(date). still thinking about different ways of making it better
